- The Social Dilemma (mentioned as a documentary, not a book)

Our phones are stealing our lives—not in big chunks, but in tiny moments that add up to years. Catherine Price argues that the issue isn’t just phone addiction—though that’s real—but rather unconscious, compulsive use that erodes our ability to focus, form memories, connect meaningfully, and feel truly alive.
