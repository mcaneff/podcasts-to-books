Dr. John Delony unpacks how modern culture has trained us to talk more and feel less, to intellectualize pain rather than hold space for it. His key insight: “We don’t need more advice. We need more presence.” Healing often happens not through answers, but through silent support and consistent action—being with, not fixing.
