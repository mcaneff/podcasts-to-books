- [Given the extensive review of the podcast transcript, there are no explicit or clearly inferred references to books, essays, or authors that align with the required format. The discussion focuses on comedy routines, personal anecdotes, pop culture, and music without mentioning literary works](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Given+the+extensive+review+of+the+podcast+transcript,+there+are+no+explicit+or+clearly+inferred+references+to+books,+essays,+or+authors+that+align+with+the+required+format.+The+discussion+focuses+on+comedy+routines,+personal+anecdotes,+pop+culture,+and+music+without+mentioning+literary+works&tag=podcaststoboo-20)

- [Note: While the transcript contains discussions that touch on themes related to these books, none are explicitly mentioned. The inferred books are based on context about mentioned personalities (Prince, Billy Joel) and general topics (meaning in adversity, strategy).

If only explicit mentions are required, the correct answer is none.
